# Titan Ui

> A Starter Framework for your React & CSS Components

## Styleguide Information

The styleguide is built using storybook which comes with a lot of features such as:

-   WCAG 2.0 testing
-   React components
-   Static markup previews

These features are built to make development a lot easier and more up to date with the other tools we use across our other react projects.

## CSS Information

-   The CSS is written following the standards of ITCSS & BEM
-   Uses custom properties for overriding styles
-   Built using PostCSS

## Typescript

-   Build a types module

## Setup

-   `npm i`
-   `npm start`

## OK, so what does it give me?

The base of Titan Ui consists of:

-   a basic reset stylesheet
-   a configurable, responsive grid system
-   a configurable typography system
-   a configurable baseline grid for vertical rhythm
-   basic styling for headings, buttons, lists, images, pictures

You also get the following third-party tools:

-   Normalize.css (v3.0.2) https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

## Prettier & Eslint Helpers

This project uses Eslint and Prettier so all developers have a similiar coding style and it checks for errors that we may have made without realising. To get maximum potential out of this you can install the eslint plugin in vs code & the prettier plugin. Once installed these plugins will follow the config in the project and help you when you are coding.
